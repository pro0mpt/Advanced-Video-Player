Prompt :- # Advanced-Video-Player
Create a PyQt5-based advanced video player interface integrated with VLC, capable of playing various video formats such as .mp4, .avi, .mkv, .mov, and .flv. The application should feature:

A video display area that dynamically resizes with the main window.
Control buttons for playing, pausing, stopping, and toggling fullscreen.
A volume slider that adjusts the audio volume.
A seek slider to jump to specific parts of the video, which should update in real-time during playback.
A "Load Video" button to open and load a video file using a file dialog.
Error handling with a message box to alert the user if an error occurs during playback.
The ability to toggle fullscreen mode with a button click.
The application should have a clean, minimalistic design with appropriate icons for each control button and should handle window close events gracefully by stopping the video playback.
